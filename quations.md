# Docker Basics:

1. What is Docker, and how does it differ from traditional virtualization?

2. Explain the key components of Docker: images, containers, and Docker Engine.

3. How do you run a Docker container based on an image?

4. What are the benefits of using Docker containers in terms of environment consistency?

5. What is a Dockerfile, and how is it used in the containerization process?

6. How would you define and use Docker volumes for persistent data storage?

7. What is Docker Compose, and how does it help in managing multi-container applications?

8. Differentiate between Docker images and containers.

# Networking and Security:

9.  Describe the different types of Docker networking modes and when you would use each.

10. How do you expose ports from a Docker container to the host machine?

11. Explain how Docker handles container isolation and security.

12. What is Docker's role in ensuring the security of the host system and other containers?

13. How can you restrict the resources (CPU, memory) a container can consume?

# Orchestration and Scaling:

14. Compare Docker Swarm and Kubernetes as container orchestration platforms.

15. What is the purpose of a Docker registry? How would you set up a private Docker registry?

16. Describe the concept of load balancing and scaling with Docker containers.

17. How do you perform rolling updates in a Docker swarm?

# Advanced Topics:

18. Explain the concept of a multi-stage Docker build and its benefits.

19. How would you set environment variables within a Docker container?

20. Describe the use of health checks in Docker containers and their significance.

21. What are Docker plugins, and how can they extend Docker's capabilities?

22. How does Docker facilitate microservices architecture and containerized applications?

# Integration and DevOps:

23. How can Docker be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline?

24. Discuss the benefits of using Docker for local development environments.

25. Describe how Docker helps in achieving consistency between development, testing, and production environments.

26. Troubleshooting and Optimization:

27. Your containerized application is crashing upon startup. What steps would you take to diagnose and fix the issue?

28. What is Docker's layer caching, and how can it impact image build times?

29. Explain methods to optimize Docker images for reduced size and enhanced performance.

30. Discuss the importance of monitoring Docker containers and suggest tools for monitoring.

31. How can you clean up unused images, containers, and resources to optimize disk space?
